Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
>Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods & tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems.
>Software engineering is important in enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

>Development of programming languages since the invention of the computer.
>Establishment of software engineering as a discipline due to the rising need resulting from more people having access to a computer.
>Rise of agile methodologies in the 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

>Requirements-gathering the user needs and preferences.
>Design- designing of the software architecture and the user interface.
>Implemetation- refers to the writing of the code.
>Testing- testing the quality standards
>Deployment- Releasing the software product to the users/public.
>Maintainance- Providing ongoing support and adjusting changes when needed.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

>Waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phrases eg requirements, design & implementation flowing down like a waterfall while the agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration & responding to change


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

>Software development- Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
>Quality Assurance Engineer- Ensures quality by designing and executing test plans.
>Project Manager- Oversees planning, execution & delivery of software products.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

>They both enhance productivity, collaboration & code quality by providing the developers with features such as code editors, version control tools & automated testing capabilities.An example of an Integrated Development Environment is a code editor eg Visual Studio. An example of a version control system is Github.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

>Changing requirements during the development cycle leads to scope creep and project delays. This can be solved by effective communication between the client and the developer.
>Tight deadlines which mounts pressure on the developer leading to a rushed development and compromised quality. This can be solved by prioritization of tasks & use of agile methodologies.
>Technical debt- These are challenges that arise due to accrued shortcuts. This can be solved by regular re- assesment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

>Unit testing- refers to testing individual components or modules of a software.
>Integration testing- refers to testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
>System testing- refers to testing the entire software system as a whole.
>Acceptance testing- refers to testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

>Prompt Engineering refers to crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
>Prompt Engineering enhances productivity,collaboration & code quality by provididng developers with useful features.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

>Vague prompt; "Write something about the importance of sleep"
>Improved prompt; "Write a 200-word article explaining how regular 8 hour sleep and regular naps improves the general health,boosts mood and aids in anxiety management.Include evidence supporting these claims."
>The improved prompt is more effective because it is clear, specific and precise.
